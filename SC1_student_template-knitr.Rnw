\section{Introduction}
Here's the first paragraph of the section, which is not indented.
As long as you keep lines together, they'll appear in the same paragraph.
A blank line will separate paragraphs.

Here's that new paragraph, this and every following paragraph is indented.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}

You can insert R code like this code chunk below, which will print the values,
  and produce a plot.
% A percent sign preceeds LaTeX comments.

% knitr code chunk options are in the <<...>>=
% Learn more here: http://yihui.name/knitr/options#chunk_options
%   echo = whether to print source code in document
%   size = size of the code text, if echoed
%   include = whether to include chunk output in document
%   fig.width = figure width in inches
%   fig.height = figure height in inches
%   out.width = scaling figure to fit on page (can be inches, or other, or relative to page size)
% Many other optios are also available!
<<plot_echo>>=
1+1
letters[5:10]
LETTERS[11:15]

# Create a data.frame called df used for an example plot
df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100))
df$y <- df$x + rnorm(100, mean = 2, sd = 0.1)

# plot the df data.frame
library(lattice)
xyplot(y ~ x, data = df,
       main = "Title is up here", sub="Subtitle is down here",
       xlab="x variable", ylab="y variable")
@

Using \verb|echo=FALSE| will allow this next code chunk to be hidden,
  but the resulting plot still displays.

<<plot_hidden, echo=FALSE>>=
# plot using ggplot
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + labs(title = "This is the title")
#p <- p + theme_bw()
print(p)
@

You can print an attractive table from R in a tabular environment.
Below are the first 10 observations from df.

% % tables are nicely produced using xtable and printing their output
% % look at help for ?xtable and ?print.xtable for many options
% <<texoutput, results='asis', echo=FALSE>>=
% library(xtable) # for tables
% xtab.out <- xtable(df[1:10,], digits=4)
% print(xtab.out, floating=FALSE, math.style.negative=TRUE)
% @

You can also write inline expressions,
  such as $\pi=\Sexpr{pi}$, and \Sexpr{1.598673e8} is a big number.
The first values in the dataframe are $\Sexpr{signif(df[1, ], 4)}$.

Equations will take a little practice, but will be beautiful.
The {\bf residual sum of squares (SS)} can be represented in many equivalent forms,
 %===============
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:sse1}
  \textrm{SSE}(\hat{\beta})
    & = &
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \{ y_{i} - (\hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} x_{i 1} + \cdots + \hat{\beta}_{p} x_{ip}) \}^2
\\ %===
    & = &
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \{ y_{i} - \hat{\mu}_{i} \}^2
\nonumber\\ %===
    & = &
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{e}_{i}^2
\nonumber\\ %===
\label{eq:epe}
    & = &
  \hat{e}^{\top} \hat{e}
\\ %===
    & = &
  (y - \hat{\mu})^{\top} (y - \hat{\mu})
\nonumber\\ %===
    & = &
  (y - \mathbf{X} \hat{\beta})^{\top} (y - \mathbf{X} \hat{\beta})
  .
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
 %===============
Equations \eqref{eq:sse1} and \eqref{eq:epe} are equivalent, and the equation
  reference numbers are connected to their labels in the equation array.

\section{OK, Go!}

Now you're ready (with practice) to create reproducible research!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Include code in an appendix, but just black-and-white
%   the development version of knitr allows you to do this
%   but not the current (2/2013) version
\appendix     % switches section numbers to letters

\section{Appendix, code}
