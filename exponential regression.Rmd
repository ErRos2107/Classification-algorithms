## Leukemia data set

The data below from Feigl and Zelen (1965) are time to death, Y (weeks), in weeks from
diagnois and log10(wbc) (the initial white blood cell count), x (lwbc), for 17 patients
suffering from leukemia. The relation between Y and x is the main aspect of interest.

```{r}
# load the data
eleuk <- read.table("http://statacumen.com/teach/SC1/SC1_HW11_Exp-leuk.dat", header = TRUE)
```
